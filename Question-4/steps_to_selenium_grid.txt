Here i am deploying the nodes and hub on single machine(WINDOWS Machine)

Download the selenium standalone server from seleniumhq.org
After successful download, extract the files.
You will now see a jar file named ex: selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar
now open command prompt and use the following command set up the hub.
	--> java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub
Once selenium hub is ready then you can check the status on the browser using 
	--> http://localhost:4444/grid/console


Open another command prompt window use the below command launch the nodes
    --> java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -port 5556 -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register 
By default when you start a node, you will get 5 instances of chrome, 5 instances of firefox and 1 instance of internet explorer

If you want to specify the number of instances of a browser, you can use the following command,
	-->java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -port 5556 -browser "browserName=chrome, maxInstances=4" -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register

To run chrome browser you need the chrome driver.Download the chrome driver and add the driver path to PATH variable.
Or the other option is to specify the path of the driver in the command, when launching a node
	--> java -jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="replacewithdriverpath" selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -port 5556 -browser "browserName=chrome, maxInstances=4" -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register

To run a client python script you need to install pip and selenium.
To install pip you need to download get-pip.py file and run
	--> python get-pip.py
To install selenium run the following command.
	--> pip install -U selenium.
