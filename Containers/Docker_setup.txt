To build containers you use Docker Engine.
Download specific version of docker engine for Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux
Steps for installing latex version of docker in ubuntu-xenial
	--> sudo apt-get install docker.io
    --> docker --version (to check docker version)
installing git(optional)
    --> sudo apt-get install git(for cloning repository)
After cloning the repository you can use root user to build the docker image or you can grant for a user using the following command
    --> sudo usermod -G docker ubuntu
To build  a project(creates image) docker build is used
if you are in the same folder where Dockerfile is present use the following command 
    --> docker build .
    other specify the path 

To run a container locally
    --> docker run -p 3000:3000 -it imageid 
        -p for port forwarding
		first 3000 is container port and second 3000 is the host port where port is running
		-i command is for interactive mode so that you can manually aferwards


To make available to kubernetes you need to push to docker registry
   --> docker login
 
To tag during build use -t 
	--> docker build -t urlogin/name
To tag an image after build
	--> docker tag imageid urlogin/name:versionid(optional)
To list all images
	-->docker images
To push to docker registry
	--> docker push urlogin/name
